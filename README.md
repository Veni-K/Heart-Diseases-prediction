# Heart-Diseases-prediction
 Using ML predict the person has normal or heart diseases with an accuracy of 80.5% .
 Heart diseases can be life-threatening, researchers are focusing on designing smart systems to accurately diagnose them based on electronic health data, with the aid of machine learning algorithms. This work presents several machine learning approaches for predicting heart diseases, using data of major health factors from patients. 
implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithm used: LogisticRegression
Accuracy achieved:80.5%
